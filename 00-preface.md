# Preface {.unnumbered}

You may access this book in the following formats:

- [Website](https://razetime.github.io/ngn-k-tutorial)
- [PDF](https://razetime.github.io/ngn-k-tutorial/ngn_k_tutorial.pdf)
- [EPUB](https://razetime.github.io/ngn-k-tutorial/ngn_k_tutorial.epub)

This book would not have been possible without the help of
[ngn](https://ngn.codeberg.page)'s dedicated work
on maintaining and teaching ngn/k, alongside many of the people in the
community who have contributed to the process of documenting and improving K.
I would like to thank all the people involved directly and indirectly with this
project.
