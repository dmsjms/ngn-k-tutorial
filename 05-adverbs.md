# Part 4: Adverbs

Any respectable programming language will have its own forms of looping. You have already seen one form of looping in K's recursive functions (`o`, function self reference). But even outside of recursion, you have seen K's looping through K's conforming operations, since they move through each element of the arrays given to them. 

Even with the power of recursion and branching, you will often find yourself in predicaments where these just 
do not fit the task.
K's general design lends itself strongly towards functional programming, and many of its adverbs help omit 
loops and branching to solve tasks concisely and quickly.

If you are acquainted with functional programming already, `'` is map, `'` (dyadic) is zip, `/` is foldl, and `\` is scanl.

Hence, you will most likely never need recursion and branching in most situations.

Each (`'`) is an adverb which takes a function or verb and applies the function on each element of an array. Yes, the symbol for each is a single quote.

### `f' x` Each

**Symbol:** `'`

**Args:** `function' array`

**Description:** Apply function to each element of array.

For example, to reverse an array, we can use the `|` verb:

```
 |'(1 2 3; 4 5 6)
(3 2 1
 6 5 4)
```



### `| x` Reverse

**Symbol:** `|`

**Args:** `| array`

**Description:** reverse the elements of an array.



and to reverse each row of a 2D array, we can do `|'`:

```
 a:3 3#!9
(0 1 2
 3 4 5
 6 7 8)
 |'a
(2 1 0
 5 4 3
 8 7 6)
```

Each can also be used dyadically, and this form is called eachboth:



### `x f' y` Each Dyad

**Symbol:** `'`

**Args:** `array/atom function' array/atom`

**Description:** Apply dyadic function to each element of both arrays. 



Each dyad zips two arrays together with a dyadic function, creating an array of the results. Both `x` and `y` must have the same length, unless either of them are atoms. When an atom is given, it is repeated to the length of the other argument (`5 f' 1 2 3` is the same as `5 5 5 f' 1 2 3`).

Each dyad and each are useful with functions that don't fully support conforming operations. For example, `!` (modulus) only penetrates to the atoms in its right argument, meaning `2 ! 3 4 5` will work, but `1 2 3 ! 3 4 5` will not. This is where `!'` comes in handy:

```
 1 2 3 ! 3 4 5
1 2 3!3 4 5         
 1 2 3 !' 3 4 5
0 0 2
 1 2 3 !' 5
0 1 2   
```

Each dyad will repeat atoms to the length of the other argument, but sometimes you need an array to behave like an atom. Say, something like this:

```
 1 2 3 !' (5 6; 5 6; 5 6) / not very ideal
(0 0
 1 0
 2 0)
```

One way to solve it is using a projection:
```
 ![;5 6]' 1 2 3
(0 0
 1 0
 2 0)
```

But the best way to do it is with eachleft('\:'):

```
 1 2 3 !\: 5 6
(0 0
 1 0
 2 0)
```

Eachleft applies a dyadic function to each element in the left array and the entire right argument. 



### `x f\: y` Each Left

**Symbol:** `\:`

**Args:** `array/atom function\: array/atom`

**Description:** Apply dyadic function to each element of `x` and the whole of `y`. 

For example, in `(a; b; c) f\: d` , we will get  `(f[a;d]; f[b;d]; f[c;d])`.

The same applies for each right, which you can probably guess the symbol for (`/:`).

## Folds and Scans

Folds and scans are used to combine values from an array to produce one or many results.



### `x f/ y` Over (Fold from left)

**Symbol:** `/`

**Args:** `any dyad/ array`

**Description:** Fold array `y` from left with a dyadic function. `x` is optional. 



There are many, many useful applications of folds, some of which are:

Fold | Verb        | What it Does                       | Example
---- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------
`+/` | Add         | Sum                                | `+/1 2 3` -> `6`
`*/` | Subtract    | Product                            | `*/3 4 5` -> `60`
`\|/`| Maximum     | Maximum                            | `\|/3 5 1` -> `5`, `\|/1 0 0` -> `1`
`&/` | Minimum     | Minimum                            | `&/3 5 1` -> `1`, `&/1 0 1 1` -> `0`
`,/` | Concatenate | Join all elements together (Raze)  | `,/(1 2 3; 4 5 6)` -> `1 2 3 4 5 6`

These folds can also be used with an initial element, providing a fallback value:

```
 0+/1 2 3
6
 0+/()
0
 1*/7 8 9
504
 1*/()
1
```

With an initial element, these are fine. But what should happen *without* one?

```
 +/()
0
 */()
1
 |/()
-9223372036854775807
 &/()
9223372036854775807
 ,/()
()
```

Sum and Product seem OK, but `|/` and `&/` have two meanings, since max and min mean different things for integers and booleans: the highest integer is what K returns by default, but the max and min booleans are 1 and 0. Hence, adding an initial element does the trick on booleans:

```
 0|/()
0
 1&/()
1
```

Scan is the same as fold, *except* it will also give you the intermediate values of the fold:

```
+\1 2 3 4 5       = 1 3 6 10 15
  1               = 1 
  1+2             = 3
    3+3           = 6
      6+4         = 10
       10+5       = 15
```



### `x f\ y` Scan (Scan from left)

**Symbol:** `\`

**Args:** `any dyad\ array`

**Description:** Fold array `y` from left with a dyadic function, producing intermediate results in an array. `x` is optional. 



Scans are useful all by themselves, but they are also *very* useful for debugging fold functions and finding out what's going wrong midway.

Scans are also one of the main ways that K lets you access intermediate values from loops, making it widely useful. `\` and `/` are two of the most important, multipurpose symbols in K.

```
 {x+y*z}\[1; 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
(1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9
 29 42 57)
```
```
 {x+y*z}'[1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
29 42 57
```

## Vocabulary from this lesson
- Adverb: A syntactic form which acts like a higher order function on both nouns and verbs.
- Each: Zap each element with function
- EachBoth: Zip elements of two arrays with a function
- Eachleft and Eachright: Zip each element in one argument with the whole other argument with a function.
- Fold: Condense an array into a single value using a function.
- Scan: fold but outputs intermediate values as an array.

## Exercises
1. `|` when used with a single argument, reverses an array. Instead, reverse an array with the usage of a single scan.
2. ngn/k's primitive symbols can be found in this page: https://k.miraheze.org/wiki/Primitives. Experiment with folds using any primitives you like. What unexpected things happen?
3. Convert an array of base-2 digits to a base-10 integer using a fold. `f/1 0 1` -> `5`.
